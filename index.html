    Hey there, first a big thank you for taking some time to check out my website. It's a little awkward introducing myself because I've had a difficult time sticking to one career path so far (where my multi-potentialites at?!), much to the dismay of my parents and teachers. But if I had to summize, I would call myself a self-led learner who is ravenously fascinated with our world. I am very curious by nature and this is reflcted in my approach to work and life. If you're intersted in seeing some of the positions I've held over my time in the workforce, please click <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jp-abah/">here</a></strong>. As of now, I work as a gas station attendant and while its not the most creative job for me, I'm learning so much about how to run a business while also refining my skills in delivering great customer experiences. Another life project I'm working on is learning to build websites like this one, in hopes I can join the brilliant people who make the internet the awesome experience it has come to be. I have so many future projects I intend to work on that range from agriculture to music, philosphy, and of course -tech. I will be posting my journey with those pursuits all on this website (as I build it!). So meta.
